# Securities-Customers-Clustering-Using-K-prototype
NCCU_MBA_Thesis
This study is designed to use statistic and machine learning methods to find out
the customer characteristics of President securities’ three major financial management
businesses (Insurance, Overseas, Wealth management), and to distinguish the key
differences between the customer groups, so that salesperson can use this to identify
the preferences of new customers in a more efficient and systematic way, thereby
improving new comer rate and transaction rate, then achieving the goal of increasing
revenue.
The process starts with the k-means clustering of the three financial management
business’ customers, so as to establish the customer sketches of these businesses and
research on the change in characteristics of customers during data time (2018, 2019).
Second step, use Logistic classification to train the model in order to distinguish from
buyers(1) to non-buyers(0), and discuss how the statistically significant features in the
model impact on customer buying behavior, so that the model can tell the new comer
buying probability in the future.
In the outcome of customer clustering of Wealth management business, we found
that there is a difference in risk preference and commodity preference when customers
selecting products among the groups, but this characteristic is extremely susceptible to
market situation(bull or bear market) and salesperson’s promotion; in the customer
groups of Insurance business, we found that the high purchase amount group comes
from the devotion of high unit price production sales, such as life insurance, medical
insurance or annuity insurance, buying age is between 40 and 70 years old; and the
low purchase amount group is the tend to buy some low unit price products such as
fixed-term insurance or some insurance rider, and some accidental, injury insurance or
a small amount of medical insurance according to demand. And the results in 2019 are
roughly the same as 2018, except for little impact of some products suspensions on
buying amount, and this infer that insurance products are most affected by age,
demand, and salesperson.
In the outcome of Logistic classification, the significant variables of the two
models are the same, which are Age, Gender, Days_of_registration,
Registered_before_2008, Registered_at_bonus_release. And Total_buy_amount is
interestingly not significant. In conclusion, it is possible to screen out users with low
potential purchasing probability by focusing on potential customers, and optimize the
services of different customer groups.
